8. **[08-enums-literals.md](08-enums-literals.md)** - Enums and literal types

### 🔴 Advanced Level (Lessons 9-12)
Master these to become a TypeScript expert.

9. **[09-advanced-types.md](09-advanced-types.md)** - Union, intersection, mapped types
10. **[10-decorators.md](10-decorators.md)** - Decorators and metadata
11. **[11-modules-namespaces.md](11-modules-namespaces.md)** - Module systems and organization
12. **[12-typescript-compiler.md](12-typescript-compiler.md)** - How TypeScript compiles

### 🎯 Practical Guides (Lessons 13-15)

13. **[13-real-world-examples.md](13-real-world-examples.md)** - Examples from this codebase

## 🎓 How to Use This Guide

### Step 1: Follow the Order
Start with Lesson 1 and work your way through. Each lesson builds on previous knowledge.

### Step 2: Practice as You Learn
- Type out the examples yourself (don't copy-paste)
- Try to modify examples
- Create your own variations

### Step 3: Reference Real Code
After each lesson, look at examples in the actual codebase:
- `src/domain/entities/` - See interfaces in action
- `src/domain/services/` - See classes and OOP
- `src/api/controllers/` - See functions and types
- `src/utils/` - See utility types and generics

### Step 4: Build Small Projects
After each section (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced), build a small project to practice.

**Beginner Project Ideas:**
- Todo list with typed functions
- Simple calculator with type safety
- User registration form validator

**Intermediate Project Ideas:**
- Class-based shopping cart
- API client with typed responses
- File system utilities

**Advanced Project Ideas:**
- Generic data store
- Type-safe form builder
- Mini dependency injection container

## 💡 Tips for Success

### 1. Don't Rush
Take time to understand each concept. It's okay to re-read sections.

### 2. Experiment
Open a TypeScript playground (https://www.typescriptlang.org/play) and try examples.

### 3. Make Mistakes
Errors are learning opportunities. Try to break things and see what happens.

### 4. Reference Documentation
When confused, check the official TypeScript docs: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/

### 5. Practice Daily
Even 30 minutes a day is better than cramming.

### 6. Teach Others
Explain concepts to someone else (or even to yourself out loud).
